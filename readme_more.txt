how many uarts does a raspberry pi have
ChatGPT said:
The number of UARTs on a Raspberry Pi depends on the model, but in general:

Most Raspberry Pi models (like the Pi 3 and Pi 4) have:

1 full-featured UART (PL011) ‚Äì this is the "main" UART.

1 mini UART (miniUART) ‚Äì a simpler secondary UART with fewer features.

So, typically:

2 UARTs total (1 PL011 + 1 miniUART)

However, by default, the full UART might be used by Bluetooth (especially on Pi 3 and Pi 4), and the miniUART is used for the serial console. You can swap them around in the config.txt if needed.

i would like to test a uart on the gpio pins on my pi. How do i wire and write in c
ChatGPT said:
Great! Testing a UART on the GPIO of your Raspberry Pi is a solid way to get into serial communication. Let‚Äôs walk through wiring and writing a simple C program.

üß∞ What You Need:
Raspberry Pi (any model with GPIO)

Female-to-female jumper wires

USB-to-Serial adapter (e.g. FTDI or CH340)

Another computer or terminal emulator to test

üîå Wiring UART on GPIO:
Default UART pins on the GPIO header:

GPIO14 (TXD) ‚Äì Pin 8

GPIO15 (RXD) ‚Äì Pin 10

GND ‚Äì Pin 6

Wiring to USB-to-Serial Adapter:


Raspberry Pi Pin	USB Serial Adapter
GPIO14 (TXD)	RX
GPIO15 (RXD)	TX
GND	GND
Be careful not to connect 5V signals to the Pi ‚Äî it expects 3.3V logic.

üõ† Enable UART on Raspberry Pi:
Edit your boot configuration:

sudo nano /boot/config.txt
Add or modify:

enable_uart=1
Disable the serial console (to free the UART):

sudo raspi-config
# Go to: Interface Options > Serial Port
# Disable login shell over serial
# Enable serial port hardware
Then reboot:

sudo reboot
üß™ Write a C Program (Send UART Data):
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <termios.h>

int main() {
    int uart0_filestream = open("/dev/serial0", O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY | O_NDELAY);
    if (uart0_filestream == -1) {
        perror("Failed to open UART");
        return 1;
    }

    struct termios options;
    tcgetattr(uart0_filestream, &options);

    if (count < 0) {
        perror("UART TX error");
        return 1;
    }

can i have a select statement on the receiving logic. I would like to not block eventually
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely ‚Äî adding a select() statement is the perfect way to make the UART receiver non-blocking or timeout-aware. Here's how to modify the UART receiving logic to use select() so it waits for data with a timeout, but doesn‚Äôt hang forever.

üõ† UART Receiver with select() (non-blocking / timeout-ready)
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

    if (uart0_filestream == -1) {
        perror("Failed to open UART");
        return 1;
    }

    struct termios options;
    tcgetattr(uart0_filestream, &options);
    options.c_cflag = B9600 | CS8 | CLOCAL | CREAD;
    options.c_iflag = IGNPAR;
    options.c_oflag = 0;
    options.c_lflag = 0;
    tcflush(uart0_filestream, TCIFLUSH);
    tcsetattr(uart0_filestream, TCSANOW, &options);

    fd_set read_fds;
    struct timeval timeout;

    while (1) {
        FD_ZERO(&read_fds);
        FD_SET(uart0_filestream, &read_fds);

        timeout.tv_sec = 2;  // 2 second timeout
        timeout.tv_usec = 0;

        int result = select(uart0_filestream + 1, &read_fds, NULL, NULL, &timeout);

        if (result == -1) {
            perror("select()");
            break;
        } else if (result == 0) {
            printf("Timeout: no data received in 2 seconds\n");
        } else {
            if (FD_ISSET(uart0_filestream, &read_fds)) {
                unsigned char rx_buffer[256];

            }
        }
    }

    close(uart0_filestream);
    return 0;
}
‚úÖ Benefits:
Doesn‚Äôt block forever waiting on read()

Easy to add other file descriptors later (e.g., stdin or socket)

Timeout gives control over polling loop frequency

Would you also like it to exit cleanly on Ctrl+C (SIGINT) or keep looping forever?

You said:
how much data does the select need to unblock
ChatGPT said:
Great question ‚Äî select() doesn't care how much data is available. It unblocks as soon as any data is ready to be read on the file descriptor.

üß† How it works:
select() is just checking: "Is there at least one byte available to read?"

The actual number of bytes available isn‚Äôt reported by select(), but the read() call afterward can tell you how much was read.

So even one byte arriving on the UART will cause select() to unblock.

If you want to know exactly how many bytes are available before calling read(), you can use ioctl() with FIONREAD:

#include <sys/ioctl.h>

int bytes_available;
ioctl(uart0_filestream, FIONREAD, &bytes_available);
Would you like to add that to the example?

You said:
yes please

‚úÖ What‚Äôs New:
Uses ioctl() to get the exact number of available bytes

Reads just that amount to avoid unnecessary blocking or over-reads

More informative output: shows how many bytes were received

Would you like to log this to a file as well, or just keep it console-based for now?

You said:
so the select unblocks every byte but the read waits for a certain amount?
ChatGPT said:
Almost! Let‚Äôs clear that up:

üîç How select() and read() behave:
‚úÖ select():
Unblocks as soon as any data (even 1 byte) is available to read.

It does not wait for a full line or buffer ‚Äî just one byte is enough.

‚úÖ read():
Will read as many bytes as are immediately available, up to the size you request.

It does not wait for your full buffer to fill, unless:

The file descriptor is in blocking mode (which it is by default unless O_NDELAY or O_NONBLOCK is used).

And the system expects more data (e.g., you ask for 100 bytes but only 1 is available ‚Äî it may block waiting for more unless non-blocking mode is set).

In your case:
Because the UART is opened with O_NDELAY, read() is non-blocking, so:

It returns immediately with whatever is available (even partial data).

If no data is available, it returns -1 and errno == EAGAIN.

üß™ So this combo works like:
select() waits for any byte.

ioctl() checks how many bytes are actually ready.

read() grabs exactly that many.

Want to switch the UART to blocking mode instead and see how read() behaves differently?

You said:
can i have some sample circuitpython code to write to a uart please
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! Here's a clean and simple example of CircuitPython code that writes to a UART ‚Äî perfect for a Raspberry Pi Pico or any board with UART support.

üß∞ What You Need:
A board running CircuitPython (e.g. Raspberry Pi Pico, Feather RP2040)

Two UART pins (TX, RX)

Jumper wires to a USB-serial adapter or another UART device

üìù Sample CircuitPython UART Write Code
import board
import busio
import time

# Set up UART using board pins (adjust pins for your board)
uart = busio.UART(tx=board.GP0, rx=board.GP1, baudrate=9600)

# Give it a moment to stabilize
time.sleep(1)

while True:
    uart.write(b"Hello from CircuitPython!\r\n")
    print("Sent message over UART.")
    time.sleep(1)
üß† Notes:
board.GP0 and board.GP1 are for the Raspberry Pi Pico (TX, RX respectively).

You can check your board's pin names with:

import board
dir(board)
Always use bytes (b"") with uart.write().

üì° Hooking It Up:
TX from your CircuitPython board ‚ûú RX on the receiving device

RX from your board ‚ûú TX on the other device (if you're also receiving)

GND shared between both

Would you like a CircuitPython example that also reads from UART (echo style)?

You said:
no such modules as board
ChatGPT said:
Ah, that likely means you're not running this on a CircuitPython-compatible board, or it's missing the proper CircuitPython firmware.

Let‚Äôs troubleshoot and get you going:

‚úÖ Quick Checklist:
Are you running CircuitPython?

When you plug in your board, do you see a USB drive called CIRCUITPY?

If not, you may need to flash CircuitPython onto your board.

Do you have the right board definition?

import board works only on actual CircuitPython boards.

If you're using CPython (regular Python on a Pi or PC), the board module won‚Äôt exist.

üîÑ If You're on Raspberry Pi (not CircuitPython):
Then you're probably using CPython, and you should use pyserial instead of busio. Here‚Äôs a version that works on a regular Raspberry Pi with Python 3:

import serial
import time

# Open the UART port (use '/dev/serial0' or '/dev/ttyS0' depending on your setup)
ser = serial.Serial('/dev/serial0', baudrate=9600, timeout=1)

while True:
    ser.write(b"Hello from Python!\r\n")
    print("Message sent.")
    time.sleep(1)
Install pyserial if you don't have it:

pip install pyserial

can you wrap the linux code up ingolang with a go routine for reading the data uisng a select inside
ChatGPT said:
Sure! Here‚Äôs how you can wrap the Linux serial communication code using Go with a goroutine for reading data and a select statement inside the goroutine. This way, the program will be non-blocking and can handle other tasks while waiting for data from the serial port.

Steps:
Install the github.com/tarm/serial package (a commonly used Go package for serial communication).

Use goroutines to handle serial data reading asynchronously.

select to avoid blocking the main program and allow handling timeouts or other events.

üß∞ Install the required package:
To communicate with the serial port in Go, you need to install the serial package. Run the following command:

go get github.com/tarm/serial
üìù Example Go Program
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/tarm/serial"
	"os"
	"time"
)

func readSerialData(serialPort *serial.Port, done chan bool) {
	buffer := make([]byte, 256) // Create a buffer to store incoming data

	for {
		// Set up the select statement
		select {
		case <-time.After(2 * time.Second): // Timeout after 2 seconds
			fmt.Println("Timeout: No data received in the last 2 seconds.")
		default:
			// Try to read data from the serial port
			n, err := serialPort.Read(buffer)
			if err != nil {
				fmt.Println("Error reading from serial port:", err)
				return
			}
			if n > 0 {
				// Process the data
				fmt.Printf("Received (%d bytes): %s\n", n, string(buffer[:n]))
			}
		}
	}
}

func main() {
	// Open the serial port (replace '/dev/serial0' with your actual port, e.g., '/dev/ttyUSB0')
	port, err := serial.OpenPort(&serial.Config{
		Port:             "/dev/serial0", // Adjust to your serial port
		Baud:             9600,
		ReadTimeout:      time.Second,
		Timeout:          time.Second,
	})
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error opening serial port:", err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
	defer port.Close()

	// Create a done channel to control goroutines
	done := make(chan bool)

	// Start the goroutine to read data
	go readSerialData(port, done)

	// Write data to the serial port every 2 seconds
	for {
		_, err := port.Write([]byte("Hello from Go!"))
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println("Error writing to serial port:", err)
			return
		}
		fmt.Println("Sent message over UART.")
		time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
	}

	// You can close done to stop the goroutine and exit (if needed).
	// <-done // Un-comment to stop after a certain condition.
}
üß† Breakdown of the Go Code:
Serial Configuration:

We use the github.com/tarm/serial package to handle serial communication. The serial port is opened with a baud rate of 9600.

Adjust the port (/dev/serial0) to whatever port your UART device is connected to (e.g., /dev/ttyUSB0 on a Raspberry Pi or other Linux devices).

Goroutine:

A goroutine is used to read from the serial port asynchronously.

It uses the select statement to handle a 2-second timeout (time.After) for blocking reads.

If data is available, it reads it and prints it out.

Main Loop:

In the main loop, we continually write "Hello from Go!" to the serial port every 2 seconds.

Timeout Handling:

The select statement ensures that if no data is received for 2 seconds, a timeout message will be printed.

üîÑ Running the Program:
Make sure your UART device is connected and available on /dev/serial0 or /dev/ttyUSB0.

Run your Go program:

go run your_program.go
It will send a message every 2 seconds and print any incoming data from the serial port.

üß™ Testing:
Serial Communication: Use a terminal program (like minicom, screen, or another serial monitor) to connect to the same serial port and see the messages being sent/received.

Timeout Handling: If there's no incoming data on the serial port for 2 seconds, the program will print the "Timeout" message.

This should give you a robust, non-blocking Go program to work with UART data using select and goroutines. Would you like to add more features, such as handling specific messages or logging to a file?

You said:
i don't want to use that serial package. Can you use the C code you first showed
ChatGPT said:
Sure! We can modify the original C code to fit into a Go program using the Cgo feature, which allows Go to call C code. This way, you can use the same UART logic in Go without using an external Go package like tarm/serial.

Key Steps:
Use Cgo to call the original C code.

Create a Go goroutine to read serial data.

Use select to manage non-blocking behavior.

üß∞ Prerequisites:
You‚Äôll need a Go compiler that supports Cgo.

Make sure you have a working environment where Go can interface with C (usually works by default on Linux).

üìù Full Go Program Using C Code:
First, here‚Äôs the original C code (modified to be used in a Go program via Cgo).

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <termios.h>
#include <sys/ioctl.h>

int uart_open(const char *device) {
    int uart_filestream = open(device, O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY | O_NDELAY);
    if (uart_filestream == -1) {
        perror("Failed to open UART");
    }
    return uart_filestream;
}

void uart_configure(int uart_filestream) {
    struct termios options;
    tcgetattr(uart_filestream, &options);
    options.c_cflag = B9600 | CS8 | CLOCAL | CREAD;
    options.c_iflag = IGNPAR;
    options.c_oflag = 0;
    options.c_lflag = 0;
    tcflush(uart_filestream, TCIFLUSH);
    tcsetattr(uart_filestream, TCSANOW, &options);
}

int uart_read(int uart_filestream, unsigned char *buffer, int buffer_size) {
    return read(uart_filestream, buffer, buffer_size);
}

void uart_write(int uart_filestream, const char *data) {
    write(uart_filestream, data, strlen(data));
}

void uart_close(int uart_filestream) {
    close(uart_filestream);
}
2. Next, wrap this C code in Go using Cgo.
Here‚Äôs how to call the above C functions from Go:

package main

    return read(uart_filestream, buffer, buffer_size);
}

uart_configure: Configures the UART with a baud rate of 9600 and settings for 8N1 (8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit).

uart_read: Reads data from the UART.

uart_write: Writes data to the UART.

uart_close: Closes the UART port.

Go goroutine (readSerialData):

This function runs in its own goroutine and continuously reads from the UART using C.uart_read().

The select logic is handled by time.Sleep() for non-blocking reads. It simulates a timeout (like select) every 2 seconds.

Main loop:

It sends "Hello from Go!" every 2 seconds via the UART.

The readSerialData goroutine listens for incoming data and prints it when received.

üß∞ To run:
Install Go if you haven‚Äôt already.

Ensure that Cgo works in your Go environment (it should by default on Linux).

Save the Go code to a .go file (e.g., main.go).

Compile and run the Go program:

go run main.go
üß™ Testing:
Open a serial monitor (e.g., minicom, screen, etc.) to the UART device and you should see messages being sent from the Go program.

Any data you send from the serial monitor should be printed by the Go program.

Let me know if you'd like further adjustments or explanations!

You said:
it thinks the c code needs string.h importing
ChatGPT said:
Ah, I see! The C code uses strlen() and strcpy() (implicitly through write()), which requires string.h to be imported.

Let's modify the C code to include #include <string.h> to handle string operations.

Here‚Äôs the updated C code wrapped for Cgo with the necessary import for string.h:

üìù Updated C Code with string.h:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <termios.h>
#include <sys/ioctl.h>
#include <string.h>  // <-- Include string.h for string functions

int uart_open(const char *device) {
    int uart_filestream = open(device, O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY | O_NDELAY);
    if (uart_filestream == -1) {
        perror("Failed to open UART");
    }
    return uart_filestream;
}

void uart_configure(int uart_filestream) {
    struct termios options;
    tcgetattr(uart_filestream, &options);
    options.c_cflag = B9600 | CS8 | CLOCAL | CREAD;
    options.c_iflag = IGNPAR;
    options.c_oflag = 0;
    options.c_lflag = 0;
    tcflush(uart_filestream, TCIFLUSH);
    tcsetattr(uart_filestream, TCSANOW, &options);
}

int uart_read(int uart_filestream, unsigned char *buffer, int buffer_size) {
    return read(uart_filestream, buffer, buffer_size);
}

void uart_write(int uart_filestream, const char *data) {
    write(uart_filestream, data, strlen(data)); // Use strlen from string.h
}

void uart_close(int uart_filestream) {
    close(uart_filestream);
}
Explanation:
The key change is the inclusion of #include <string.h>, which provides the necessary functions like strlen used in the uart_write function.

You said:
<-done causes a compiler issue
ChatGPT said:
Ah, I see the problem! The <-done line in the main program is causing an issue because it‚Äôs used for waiting for the goroutine to finish, but in your case, the program is expected to keep running indefinitely since the main loop writes data every 2 seconds. To fix this, we can either:

Remove <-done because the program doesn't need to wait for the goroutine to finish, as it will keep running.

Alternatively, we can use a select statement to manage the goroutine gracefully or handle user input for cleanup.

Here‚Äôs how we can fix it:

Option 1: Simply Remove <-done (Program Will Run Indefinitely)
If you want the program to just keep sending and reading data, you don't need to wait for the goroutine. Remove the <-done line and let the program run forever.

Here‚Äôs the updated code without <-done:

package main

/*
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <termios.h>
#include <sys/ioctl.h>

int uart_open(const char *device) {
    int uart_filestream = open(device, O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY | O_NDELAY);
    if (uart_filestream == -1) {
        perror("Failed to open UART");
    }
    return uart_filestream;
}

void uart_configure(int uart_filestream) {
    struct termios options;
    tcgetattr(uart_filestream, &options);
    options.c_cflag = B9600 | CS8 | CLOCAL | CREAD;
    options.c_iflag = IGNPAR;
    options.c_oflag = 0;
    options.c_lflag = 0;
    tcflush(uart_filestream, TCIFLUSH);
    tcsetattr(uart_filestream, TCSANOW, &options);
}

int uart_read(int uart_filestream, unsigned char *buffer, int buffer_size) {
    return read(uart_filestream, buffer, buffer_size);
}

void uart_write(int uart_filestream, const char *data) {
    write(uart_filestream, data, strlen(data)); // Use strlen from string.h
}

			// Handle read error
			fmt.Println("Error reading from UART.")
			return
		}

		// Non-blocking behavior: Timeout every 2 seconds
		time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
	}
}
Explanation:
The <-done line has been removed because you don't need to block the main thread waiting for the done channel. Since your program is intended to keep running indefinitely and keep sending data every 2 seconds, there‚Äôs no need to block.

go readSerialData(uart) starts the reading process in the background (in a goroutine).

The main loop writes to the UART every 2 seconds.

Option 2: Use select to Handle Graceful Exit
If you'd like to handle graceful exit or add some other condition to stop the program, you can use a select loop with a signal channel or timeouts.

Here‚Äôs an example:

package main

/*
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <termios.h>
#include <sys/ioctl.h>
#include <string.h> // Including string.h for string functions

int uart_open(const char *device) {
    int uart_filestream = open(device, O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY | O_NDELAY);
    if (uart_filestream == -1) {
        perror("Failed to open UART");
    }
    return uart_filestream;
}

void uart_configure(int uart_filestream) {
    struct termios options;
    tcgetattr(uart_filestream, &options);
    options.c_cflag = B9600 | CS8 | CLOCAL | CREAD;
    options.c_iflag = IGNPAR;
    options.c_oflag = 0;
    options.c_lflag = 0;
    tcflush(uart_filestream, TCIFLUSH);
    tcsetattr(uart_filestream, TCSANOW, &options);
}

int uart_read(int uart_filestream, unsigned char *buffer, int buffer_size) {
    return read(uart_filestream, buffer, buffer_size);
}

void uart_write(int uart_filestream, const char *data) {
    write(uart_filestream, data, strlen(data)); // Use strlen from string.h
}

void uart_close(int uart_filestream) {
    close(uart_filestream);
}
*/
import "C"
import (
	"fmt"

func main() {
	// Open UART
	device := "/dev/serial0" // Adjust this path as necessary
	uart := C.uart_open(C.CString(device))
	if uart == -1 {
		fmt.Println("Error: Unable to open UART.")
		os.Exit(1)
	}
	defer C.uart_close(uart)

	// Configure UART
	C.uart_configure(uart)

	// Start a goroutine for reading UART data
	go readSerialData(uart)

	// Setup a channel to catch signals (e.g., SIGINT for Ctrl+C)
	signalChannel := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
	signal.Notify(signalChannel, syscall.SIGINT, syscall.SIGTERM)

	// Write data to UART every 2 seconds
	for {
		select {
		case <-signalChannel:
			fmt.Println("Received signal, exiting...")
			return // Gracefully exit
		default:
			message := "Hello from Go!\r\n"
			C.uart_write(uart, C.CString(message))
			fmt.Println("Sent message over UART.")
			time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
		}
	}
}

func readSerialData(uart C.int) {
	buffer := make([]byte, 256)

	for {
		// Read data from UART
		n := C.uart_read(uart, (*C.uchar)(unsafe.Pointer(&buffer[0])), C.int(len(buffer)))
		if n > 0 {
			// Print received data
			fmt.Printf("Received (%d bytes): %s\n", int(n), string(buffer[:n]))
		} else if n < 0 {
			// Handle read error
			fmt.Println("Error reading from UART.")
			return
		}

		// Non-blocking behavior: Timeout every 2 seconds
		time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
	}
}
Explanation of Option 2:
Signal Handling: The program listens for SIGINT (Ctrl+C) or SIGTERM signals. When one of those signals is received, the program will exit gracefully.

select statement: The select inside the main loop allows for both:

Graceful exit on signal.

Continuing UART communication if no signal is received.

To Summarize:
If you want the program to keep running indefinitely, just remove <-done.

If you need a way to exit gracefully, use the select loop as shown in Option 2.

Let me know which approach works better for you or if you need further adjustments!

You said:
can i have the pi pico circuitpython read data as well please
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! Here's how you can have your Raspberry Pi Pico running CircuitPython read data from a UART connection and print it over USB (to the REPL/serial console).

‚úÖ What You'll Need:
Raspberry Pi Pico (or similar CircuitPython board)

CircuitPython installed on the Pico

Jumper wires for connecting UART TX/RX

Another UART device (like another Pico, Raspberry Pi, or USB-Serial cable)

üîå Wiring (Pico UART pins):
We'll use GP0 (TX) and GP1 (RX) on the Pico.

Pico UART ‚ûú External device:

GP0 ‚ûú RX of other device

GP1 ‚ûú TX of other device

GND ‚ûú GND

üß™ CircuitPython UART Read Example:
import board
import busio
import time
import supervisor

# Setup UART (TX on GP0, RX on GP1) at 9600 baud
uart = busio.UART(tx=board.GP0, rx=board.GP1, baudrate=9600, timeout=0.1)

# Optional: allow auto-reload off so we don't reset when writing
supervisor.runtime.autoreload = False

print("UART Reader Ready")

while True:
    data = uart.read(32)  # Read up to 32 bytes
    if data is not None:
        print("Received:", data.decode("utf-8", errors="ignore"))
    time.sleep(0.1)
üîç What it does:
Reads up to 32 bytes from the UART.

If any data is available, it prints it to the USB serial console.

It runs every 100ms in a loop.

It tries to decode the bytes as UTF-8 for easier readability.

üìü How to View Output:
Connect your Pico via USB.

Open the CircuitPython REPL/console (e.g., using Mu editor or screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200 on Linux).

Send data to the Pico's UART RX (GP1) ‚Äî you'll see it printed in the REPL.

Would you also like an echo version (where it replies back on TX)?

You said:
data.decode has an error
ChatGPT said:
Ah, good catch! That can happen for a couple of reasons in CircuitPython ‚Äî especially if uart.read() returns non-decodable binary data or None.

Let me walk you through a safer and corrected version that handles this properly.

‚úÖ Updated and Safer CircuitPython UART Read Example:
import board
import busio
import time
import supervisor

# Set up UART on GP0 (TX) and GP1 (RX)
uart = busio.UART(tx=board.GP0, rx=board.GP1, baudrate=9600, timeout=0.1)

# Optional: stop auto-reload when files change (not required, just stable for UART work)
supervisor.runtime.autoreload = False

print("UART Reader Ready")

while True:
    data = uart.read(32)  # Try to read up to 32 bytes
    if data:
        try:
            text = data.decode("utf-8").strip()
            print("Received:", text)
        except UnicodeDecodeError:
            print("Received non-text data:", data)
    time.sleep(0.1)
üîß Fix Details:
if data: ensures you don't call .decode() on None.

The try...except block catches cases where the bytes aren't valid UTF-8.

.strip() just cleans up any trailing \r\n.

üìå Pro tip:
If you're sending raw binary or data in another encoding (like from a Go program or microcontroller), you might skip decoding entirely and just work with data as raw bytes.

Let me know if you want to echo the data back too!

You said:
i get n<0 on the linux end
ChatGPT said:
Got it ‚Äî if you're seeing n < 0 from your Linux Go/C UART code, that means the read() system call failed. This typically indicates a serial port error or misconfiguration.

Let‚Äôs walk through the most likely causes and how to fix them.

üõ†Ô∏è 1. Check if UART is enabled on the Pi
Run this to make sure the serial interface is available:

ls -l /dev/serial0
You should see it pointing to /dev/ttyAMA0 or /dev/ttyS0.

If not, enable it via:

sudo raspi-config
# ‚Üí Interface Options ‚Üí Serial ‚Üí Login shell: No, Enable hardware serial: Yes
Reboot after enabling.

üõ†Ô∏è 2. Permissions: Make sure your user can access the serial port
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
Then log out and back in.

üõ†Ô∏è 3. Use blocking I/O to avoid read() returning -1 immediately
In the C code used by your Go wrapper, you're opening the UART with O_NDELAY, which makes read() non-blocking. That means if there's no data waiting, read() returns immediately with -1 and errno = EAGAIN.

‚úÖ Fix: Remove O_NDELAY from the open() flags.

Change this line:

int uart_filestream = open(device, O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY | O_NDELAY);
To this:

int uart_filestream = open(device, O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY);
That way, read() will wait until data is available, unless you set a timeout in the termios settings ‚Äî which you are doing already (ReadTimeout in Go or VMIN/VTIME in C).

üõ†Ô∏è 4. Check wiring (cross RX/TX)
Make sure:

Pico's TX (GP0) ‚Üí Pi's RX

Pico's RX (GP1) ‚Üí Pi's TX

GND ‚Üí GND

Double-check that you're not connecting TX-to-TX.

üõ†Ô∏è 5. Test with minicom or screen
You can use a known-good terminal program to check the Pi's UART directly:

sudo apt install minicom
minicom -b 9600 -o -D /dev/serial0
If you can see Pico data in minicom but not in your Go program, the issue is with the code.

‚úÖ Summary of Fixes

Problem	Fix
read() returns -1	Remove O_NDELAY, use blocking I/O
UART not enabled	Use raspi-config to enable it
Permissions error	Add user to dialout group
Bad wiring	Cross RX/TX, check GND
Wrong device	Confirm /dev/serial0 or /dev/ttyS0
Would you like me to edit the Go+C code snippet with this fix applied?

You said:
points to AMA10
ChatGPT said:
Perfect ‚Äî if /dev/serial0 points to /dev/ttyAMA0, you're in good shape! That means you're using the full UART on the Pi (not the mini UART), which is the preferred UART for reliable serial communication.

So your wiring and OS config are probably fine, and the remaining issue is likely due to:

üîß O_NDELAY in your open() call
This flag causes read() to be non-blocking. If no data is ready when read() runs, it returns -1 with errno == EAGAIN.

‚úÖ Fix the C code by removing O_NDELAY
Here's the corrected version:

int uart_filestream = open(device, O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY); // Removed O_NDELAY
Now, your read() will block until:

At least one byte is available, or

A timeout occurs (you've already set VTIME in termios, so that's fine)

üîÑ Recap of What You Should Do:
Update your C open() line to remove O_NDELAY.

Recompile your Go program (if embedded via Cgo).

Run the Pico code to send data first.

Then run your Go program ‚Äî read() should now receive actual bytes.

If you'd like, I can paste your full updated Go+C code with that fix ready to go. Want that?

You said:
no i said AMA10
ChatGPT said:
Ahhh ‚Äî I see now! You said /dev/serial0 is pointing to /dev/ttyAMA10 ‚Äî that‚Äôs definitely not typical. Normally, serial0 maps to /dev/ttyAMA0 or /dev/ttyS0.

üò¨ What ttyAMA10 Likely Means
That suggests your system has multiple serial devices active ‚Äî maybe Bluetooth, overlays, or serial GPIOs from device tree overlays ‚Äî and you're ending up with an unexpected UART index.

üß≠ Let's Fix It
üîç Step 1: List All UART Devices
Run:

dmesg | grep tty
Look for entries like:

[    0.000000] ... ttyAMA0 at MMIO ...
[    0.000000] ... ttyS0 at MMIO ...
[    0.000000] ... ttyAMA10 at MMIO ...
Also check:

ls -l /dev/serial*
This shows symlinks for serial0 and serial1.

üõ†Ô∏è Step 2: Check Device Tree Overlay
Check /boot/config.txt for anything like:

dtoverlay=uart10
dtoverlay=uart2
These enable additional UARTs on certain GPIO pins (only on Pi 4/5 or Compute Modules usually). If you're not using them, remove or comment out those lines.

You likely only need:

enable_uart=1
Optionally:

dtoverlay=disable-bt
That frees up the main UART (ttyAMA0) from Bluetooth.

Then reboot:

sudo reboot
üß™ Step 3: Verify Again After Reboot
Once rebooted:

ls -l /dev/serial0
‚úÖ It should now point to /dev/ttyAMA0 or /dev/ttyS0.

üß∞ Summary
ttyAMA10 suggests an extra UART overlay is active.

You likely only want one UART ‚Äî the default.

Clean up /boot/config.txt and reboot.

Then serial0 should work reliably.

Would you like help checking which GPIOs ttyAMA10 is mapped to?

You said:
I'm on a pi500 and i don't have any reference to uart in the config
ChatGPT said:
Thank you for the clarification. Given that you're using a Raspberry Pi 500 and have confirmed that /dev/serial0 points to /dev/ttyAMA10, it's important to understand that the Raspberry Pi 500 utilizes the RP1 coprocessor, which can assign UART devices starting from ttyAMA0 up to ttyAMA15. The assignment of these UART devices is managed by the RP1 firmware and can vary depending on the configuration and usage of the UARTs.

Understanding UART Device Assignments
The assignment of UART devices on the Raspberry Pi 500 is as follows:

/dev/ttyAMA0 to /dev/ttyAMA15: These are the UART devices available on the Raspberry Pi 500. The specific UART device assigned to /dev/serial0 is determined by the RP1 firmware and can vary.

Determining the Active UART Device
To determine which UART device is currently active and corresponds to /dev/serial0, you can use the following command:

ls -l /dev/serial0
This will show you the symlink pointing to the actual UART device. For example:

lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 7 Apr 27 12:34 /dev/serial0 -> ttyAMA10
In this case, /dev/serial0 is pointing to /dev/ttyAMA10.

Accessing the UART Device
Once you've identified the correct UART device, you can access it using standard serial communication tools or libraries. For example, in Python, you can use the pyserial library:

import serial

# Open the UART device
ser = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyAMA10', 9600)

# Read data
data = ser.read(100)
print(data)

# Close the UART device
ser.close()
Ensure that the baud rate (9600 in this example) matches the configuration of the device you're communicating with.

Conclusion
The assignment of UART devices on the Raspberry Pi 500 is managed by the RP1 firmware and can vary. By checking the symlink of /dev/serial0, you can determine which UART device is currently active. Once identified, you can access it using standard serial communication methods.


Sources
You said:
why do i chage it to ttyAMA10 given the symlink serial0 is to the same
ChatGPT said:
You're absolutely right to ask ‚Äî if /dev/serial0 is a symlink to /dev/ttyAMA10, you do not need to change anything in your code. You can (and probably should) just use /dev/serial0.

‚úÖ Why use /dev/serial0?
/dev/serial0 is:

A stable alias provided by the system.

Automatically updated to point to the correct UART device (like ttyAMA0, ttyS0, or ttyAMA10) depending on your Pi model and configuration.

Easier to write portable code across different Pi boards.

‚úÖ So what should you do?
Just keep your code like this:

int uart_filestream = open("/dev/serial0", O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY);
Even if serial0 points to ttyAMA10, this is fine ‚Äî it just means your Pi 500 assigned that UART device via the RP1 chip.

üîÑ Summary
Don't change to ttyAMA10 manually ‚Äî stick with serial0.

That way, if the mapping ever changes (e.g., after a config or firmware update), your code still works.

It's the same as using /dev/stdin instead of figuring out what actual TTY you're on ‚Äî abstraction is your friend.

Do you want to verify that serial0 is working correctly now with the read() changes?

You said:
it doesn't work . I want the serial on pins GPIO14 & GPIO15 please
ChatGPT said:
Perfect ‚Äî thanks for clarifying! If you want UART on GPIO14 (TXD) and GPIO15 (RXD) on your Raspberry Pi 500, we‚Äôll need to make sure those pins are connected to the right UART, and that the system is properly configured to enable that UART.

Let's walk through everything step by step to get UART on GPIO14/15 working.

üß≠ Step 1: Identify GPIO14/15 and Their UART
GPIO14 (pin 8) = TXD

GPIO15 (pin 10) = RXD

On older Pis, this was /dev/ttyAMA0.
On the Pi 500, thanks to the RP1 I/O chip, these are still valid UART pins ‚Äî but the associated UART device might now be /dev/ttyAMA10, which is what you're seeing.

So yes ‚Äî on the Pi 500, ttyAMA10 is mapped to GPIO14/15 by default.

‚úÖ You're already targeting the correct UART device!

üõ†Ô∏è Step 2: Enable GPIO14/15 for UART (if not already)
Edit /boot/firmware/config.txt (not just /boot/config.txt on the Pi 500):

sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt
Add or ensure this line is present:

enable_uart=1
You don‚Äôt need dtoverlay=disable-bt on the Pi 500 unless you're having a conflict (e.g. Bluetooth using UART).

Save and exit, then reboot:

sudo reboot
üß™ Step 3: Verify /dev/ttyAMA10 is active
After reboot:

ls -l /dev/serial0
If it points to /dev/ttyAMA10, and you‚Äôre using GPIO14/15 ‚Äî perfect.

You can also confirm with:

dmesg | grep tty
You should see ttyAMA10 initialized.

üß™ Step 4: Test UART
You can hook up your Pi‚Äôs GPIO14/15 to another device (e.g. Pi Pico or USB serial adapter) like this:


Pi GPIO	Other Device
GPIO14 (TXD)	RX
GPIO15 (RXD)	TX
GND	GND
Then send something from the Pi:

echo "hello world" > /dev/ttyAMA10
Or use a small test C or Python program to send data via /dev/serial0.

‚úÖ In Summary
On the Pi 500, GPIO14/15 = /dev/ttyAMA10

/dev/serial0 should point to that automatically ‚Äî so using /dev/serial0 is correct

Use enable_uart=1 in /boot/firmware/config.txt

After reboot, your code should work as long as you remove O_NDELAY from open()
